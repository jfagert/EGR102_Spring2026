    "Vectors are essential in many fields of engineering. They are typically associated with physical quantities such as position, velocity, or acceleration. You'll be learning some of those uses in your other classes this semester. For our purposes, let's explore how we define vectors, and some of the ways that we can manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the point $p = (1,2,-1)$ in 3-dimensional space. We can associate a position vector $\\mathbf{v}$ with this point, which is the vector from the origin to this point,\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we wish to refer to the specific entries in any vector, we refer to its components. For example, the x-component of $\\mathbf{v}$ is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are often two critical measurements that are used with vectors. The first is the $\\textit{length}$ of the vector, which is often useful for physical vectors (e.g., the overall magnitude of an object's velocity). This length is defined using the Pythagorean Theorem, and is given by the following expression for an $n$-dimensional space:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|=\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \\cdots + v_n^2}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For the vector $v$ given above, this length can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|=\\sqrt{(1)^2 + (2)^2 + (-1)^2}=\\sqrt{6}\\approx 2.45$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we use two vertical lines on either side of the vector to denote length. The length of a vector is also sometimes described using phrases like $\\textit{magnitude of the vector}$ or $\\textit{norm of the vector}$. A vector with a length of 1 is called a $\\textit{unit vector}$. Any vector can be made a unit vector by dividing the vector by its own length. A unit vector created in this way always has the same direction as the original vector. For example, a unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{v}$ can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{u}=\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\approx \\begin{bmatrix} 0.408 \\\\ 0.816 \\\\ -0.418 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector $\\mathbf{v}$, as represented above, is called a column vector. We can also have row vectors such as the following\n",
    " \\begin{align*}\n",
    " \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} p & q & r \\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    " \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of converting a column vector to a row vector or vice-versa is called taking the $\\textit{transpose}$ of the vector and is denoted with a superscript $T$. For example, the transpose of the row vector $\\mathbf{u}$ from above is\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbf{u}^T &= \\begin{bmatrix} p \\\\ q \\\\ r \\end{bmatrix}\n",

    "z\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}  = px + qy + zr\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The second key measurement with vectors is known as the $\\textit{dot product}$. If we start with two column vectors $$\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\mathbf{w}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ w_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$ of length $n$ (i.e., they are $n$-dimensional), then we can take the ${\\textit dot product}$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{w} = v_1w_1 + v_2w_2 + \\cdots + v_nw_n.$$\n",
    "In some sense, the dot product is a measure of how aligned two vectors are. Here's the key formula:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{w} = \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|\\cos\\theta$$\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$.\n",
